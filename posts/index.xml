My goal in sharing this is twofold: to help those who may not believe in mental illnesses understand the struggle, and to encourage others battling similar issues to seek help.
The Beginning of My Struggle Since May 2023, I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with OCD and health anxiety. It started with an irrational fear of rabies.</description></item><item><title>Trust Regions in Optimization: From Reinforcement Learning to Beyond</title><link>https://myxik.github.io/posts/reasonable-effectiveness-tr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://myxik.github.io/posts/reasonable-effectiveness-tr/</guid><description>In deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL), optimization is at the heart of progress. While many of us simply call optimizer.step() in our training scripts, there lies a rich world of ideas and techniques that can improve both the stability and performance of our models. In this article, we dive into the concept of trust regions in optimization, examine how they helped overcome issues in RL, discuss their applications in other areas, and speculate on why renewed interest in these methods might be on the horizon with the rise in available compute.</description></item></channel></rss>
